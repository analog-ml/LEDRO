You: 

You are an experienced analog circuit designer. You are given a SPICE netlist together with hierarchical building block information (transistor names and their functions in the given netlist). You need to do sizing optimization with the following target: Gain >= 1400, UGBW >= 1.0e8, Phrase Margin >= 70, Power <= 1mA with the 65nm PTM technology node. As simultaneously optimize all transistors and design targets with conventional methods (i.e., reinforcement learning or Bayesian Optimization) will result in many redundant simulation steps. Your task is to derive a efficient sizing optimization strategy, based on selecting which block to focus on to each steps, and the weight coefficients to construct Figure of Merits (for example, FoM = w\_g \* (current gain - target gain) + w\_ugbw ( current ugbw - target ugbw) + w\_pm (current phrase margin - target phrase margin) + w\_power (current power - target power)). The generated strategy should be target to quickly achieve the design targets with minimal simulation steps required. Try to output sequence of weight coefficients that avoid suddenly discrupted transitions (quickly jumps or drops) the overall FoM during training. Normalize weight coefficients between 0 and 1, and sum of weight coefficients is 1 Please return your strategy the following format

Thought for 1m 12s

Here's a phased, block-focused sizing strategy (units: **gain** = V/V, **ugbw** = Hz, **phase\_margin** = degrees, **power** = A). The weights are normalized (sum = 1) and change smoothly between phases to avoid abrupt FoM jumps.

Notes / practical tips for minimal simulation count

-   Per-phase search-space: restrict tuning variables to the few most effective knobs for that block (e.g., input pair W & bias for first stage; mirror ratios/cascode W for wide-swing mirror; Ccomp + second-stage W for phase control). Narrow ranges (±2–3×) speed convergence.
    
-   Optimizer inside each phase: use a low-budget local Bayesian/gradient-free search (10–30 sims) or quasi-Newton on a small parameter subset — because the block focus makes each step much more informative than a global search.
    
-   Smooth weight transitions: the weight schedule above was chosen so each coefficient changes gradually between phases (avoid sudden flips in priorities) — this reduces sudden FoM spikes and stabilizes training.
    
-   Evaluate multi-metric stop checks at each sampled point (not only the objective used by the optimizer) so you can early-exit a phase once the stop condition is met.
    
-   Units and metrics: treat gain as linear V/V in stop\_conditions; UGBW in Hz; phase\_margin in degrees; power in Ampere.
    

If you want, I can convert this into a per-block parameter list (which transistor widths, bias voltages, and Ccomp to vary per phase) and produce recommended search ranges and a low-budget sampling plan for each phase.
