Nice — this is a folded-cascode style differential amplifier. I grouped the transistors into logical subcircuits (level-1) and into functional stages (level-2). If you want a different partition (e.g. combine some blocks), say so and I’ll reformat.

Hierarchial 1

-   Subcircuit 1: M1, M2 (PMOS differential input pair)
    
-   Subcircuit 2: M3 (PMOS tail / bias current source for the input pair, driven by VBP1)
    
-   Subcircuit 3: M4, M5, M6, M7 (PMOS cascode/load network at the top — cascode transistors M6/M7 with series PMOSs M4/M5)
    
-   Subcircuit 4: M8, M9 (NMOS folded-path transistors / active mirror/cascode that connect the PMOS side to the NMOS sinks)
    
-   Subcircuit 5: M10, M11 (NMOS tail current sinks / biased by VBN2)
    

Hierarchial 2

-   Subcircuit 1: Input stage — M1, M2, M3 (differential input pair with its PMOS current source)
    
-   Subcircuit 2: Folded-cascode stage — M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9 (PMOS cascode/load + the NMOS folded-path devices that form the folded-cascode transfer to the output)
    
-   Subcircuit 3: Output / single-ended node — (output node realized at drains of M7 and M9; devices directly driving VOUT are M7 and M9 — included above in the folded-cascode stage)
    
-   Subcircuit 4: Bias / tail sinks — M10, M11 (bottom current sinks providing bias for the folded path)
    

Notes (brief):

-   VBP1 biases M3; VBP2 biases the PMOS cascodes M6/M7; VBN1 biases the NMOS folded-path gates M8/M9; VBN2 biases bottom sinks M10/M11.
    
-   The single-ended output VOUT is formed where the PMOS path (M7) and NMOS folded node (M9) meet; the central differential pair nodes are N006 (M1 drain) and N005 (M2 drain).
    

If you want this exported as a hierarchical SPICE subckt list (with explicit subckt names and pins), I can produce that next.

let's analysize the circuit, give hierarchical level that target to analog sizing step, where each subcircuit of different hierarchicy is optimized sequentially

Great — below I give a hierarchical decomposition **targeted specifically for an analog sizing workflow**, i.e. a sequence of subcircuits you would optimize one-by-one (coarse → fine) to reach a final sized amplifier. For each hierarchical level I list the transistor groups, the suggested **sizing order**, the **design objective(s)** for that group and the **primary knobs / constraints** you should tune while sizing it. This is practical: start with bias and currents, then size gain-producing devices, then cascodes and output path, and finally do global re-tuning & matching.

# High-level summary (what to optimize first)

1.  **Set bias currents & headroom** (bottom sinks, bias generators) — fixes DC operating points.
    
2.  **Size input differential pair** for target gm / input noise / input common-mode.
    
3.  **Size cascodes and folded-path transistors** for gain and output swing.
    
4.  **Size output devices and compensation for load** (if any).
    
5.  **Fine-tune bias networks and matching** (mirror ratios, W/L multiples, device matching).
    
6.  **System-level check** (gain, phase margin if compensation present, swing, noise, mismatch, layout constraints).

# Hierarchical Level targeted to sizing (coarse → fine)

## Hierarchical Level 1 — Top logical blocks (coarse groups; first pass)

-   **Subcircuit 1 (Bottom sinks / tail currents):** M10, M11  
    *Purpose:* establish total tail currents for the two folded branches; primary sizing start point.  
    *Objective:* set currents consistent with desired gm, bandwidth, and power.  
    *Knobs / constraints:* choose current (via W/L and m), ensure VDS >= VDS(sat)+margin, preserve headroom for cascodes above.
    
-   **Subcircuit 2 (Bias generator for input tail / bias node VBP1):** M3  
    *Purpose:* provide bias for input PMOS tail.  
    *Objective:* produce a stable current and Vbp1.  
    *Knobs:* W/L and mirror ratio if M3 is part of a mirror; ensure proper Vgs bias.
    
-   **Subcircuit 3 (Input differential pair):** M1, M2  
    *Purpose:* main gm source and input matching.  
    *Objective:* meet input transconductance (gm), input-referred noise, and input common-mode range.  
    *Knobs / constraints:* W/L (sets gm and ID), device multiples m for matching, keep VDS and VGS in desired region; trade-off between noise (wider devices) and parasitic capacitance.
    
-   **Subcircuit 4 (Top PMOS cascode / load network):** M4, M5, M6, M7  
    *Purpose:* cascode the PMOS loads to increase output impedance (gain) and isolate input nodes from output.  
    *Objective:* maximize ro seen by input pair while preserving output swing.  
    *Knobs / constraints:* cascode device W/L and bias VBP2; set Vsb/Vgs to keep cascodes in saturation. Balance cascode heads to avoid stacking headroom problems.
    
-   **Subcircuit 5 (Folded-path NMOS transfer / active load):** M8, M9  
    *Purpose:* NMOS folded-path transistors translate PMOS differential currents to the bottom NMOS sinks and help form output node. They also form common-mode/ single-ended conversion.  
    *Objective:* ensure correct current steering, maintain ro, and limit systematic offset.  
    *Knobs / constraints:* W/L and bias VBN1 to put these in strong enough inversion for good output resistance but not so large to kill swing.
    
-   **Subcircuit 6 (Bias generators for cascodes / NMOS gates):** (implicit bias sources: VBP2 for M6/M7, VBN1 for M8/M9, VBN2 for M10/M11) — Not explicit MOS devices here but important bias nets to tune.  
    *Purpose:* set Vbp2, Vbn1, Vbn2 node voltages.  
    *Objective:* ensure cascodes and sinks remain in required regions and mirror ratios are correct.
    

---

## Hierarchical Level 2 — Functional stages (medium granularity; next pass)

-   **Stage 1: Bias & sinks stage:** M10, M11, M3 (and bias nets VBN2, VBP1)  
    *Sizing order:* M10/M11 → M3.  
    *Why:* bottom sinks fix currents; M3 sets the PMOS tail bias that determines differential pair current split.
    
-   **Stage 2: Input stage (differential amplifier):** M1, M2 (plus connection to M3)  
    *Sizing order:* pick W/L for M1/M2 to hit gm and noise targets given the currents set in Stage 1. Set device multiples for matching.  
    *Why:* input device gm and input capacitance drive frequency response and noise.
    
-   **Stage 3: Folded cascode / gain stage:** M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9 (group PMOS cascodes with NMOS folded transistors)  
    *Sizing order:* cascode biases (VBP2 and M4/M5) → cascode devices M6/M7 → folded NMOS M8/M9.  
    *Why:* these devices determine stage gain (ro of loads) and output node impedance; they must be sized after input gm is known so you can set W/L for required output resistance and headroom.
    
-   **Stage 4: Output node and load interaction:** M7 & M9 (the devices directly connected to VOUT)  
    *Sizing order:* refine M7/M9 to meet output swing, output resistance, and load drive.  
    *Why:* this is where single-ended VOUT is formed; adjust to balance DC offset and meet swing.
    
-   **Stage 5: Final bias trimming & matching:** all bias nodes and mirror ratios (VBP1, VBP2, VBN1, VBN2) and device multiples.  
    *Sizing order:* iterate after above stages to correct small offsets, common-mode, and gain accuracy.
    

---

## Hierarchical Level 3 — Fine device groups (final pass / layout-aware)

-   **Group A: Matched transistor pairs:**
    
    -   Input pair matching: M1 ↔ M2 (match W/L and layout; set m equal).
        
    -   Top mirror/cascodes symmetry: M4 ↔ M5 and M6 ↔ M7 if placed symmetrically.  
        *Objective:* minimize systematic offset and preserve CMRR.
        
-   **Group B: Current mirror ratio devices (if present):** M3 relative to M10/M11 (if M3 forms part of a mirror)  
    *Objective:* set exact current scaling (unit devices, integer multiples).
    
-   **Group C: Cascode bias devices & headroom enforcement:** individual sizing of M6, M7 (cascode transistors) to control VDS on input pair drains and headroom margin.
    
-   **Group D: Output pair transconductance tuning:** refine M7 and M9 W/L to satisfy single-ended output swing and impedance to load; check short-circuit and transient behavior.
    
-   **Group E: Device sizing multiples for matching & layout:** adjust `m` parameters (device fingers) to achieve matching, routability and fit layout density.

# Practical sizing sequence (step-by-step recipe)

1.  **Pick total tail current (Power budget)** — decide amplifier current per side. This is set by M10/M11 W/L and their bias VBN2. (Level1 Subcircuit 1)
    
    -   Target: overall power consumption and desired gm. Choose ID per branch.
        
2.  **Size/verify bias devices** (M3 & bias nets) — ensure VBP1 gives correct Vgs for input tail PMOS; set M3 W/L so differential pair sees correct current. (Level1 Subcircuit 2)
    
3.  **Size the input pair (M1,M2)** for gm, Vov, and input-referred noise given the fixed ID.
    
    -   Rule-of-thumb: choose Vov (0.1−0.3×VDD for low-power or higher for speed), compute W to meet ID = 0.5 \* μpCox \* (W/L) \* Vov^2 (or use process models). Ensure matching: make M1=M2 and use multiples. (Level1 Subcircuit 3)
        
4.  **Set cascode bias voltages (VBP2,VBN1)** so that input device drains and cascode devices have enough VDS for saturation. Size M4/M5 (upper series PMOSs) to supply required headroom. (Level1 Subcircuit 4)
    
5.  **Size folded-path NMOSs (M8,M9)** to translate currents to bottom sinks while providing high output resistance (ro). Increase W/L if you need larger ro (higher gain), but watch output capacitance and bias shift. (Level1 Subcircuit 5)
    
6.  **Refine output devices (M7,M9)** to meet output swing & loading requirements. (Level2 Stage 4)
    
7.  **Iterate bias network & bottom sinks (M10,M11, VBN2)** to correct any DC offset, common-mode and ensure sinks stay in saturation across input range. (Levels 1 & 2 biases)
    
8.  **Fine match & layout considerations:** set device finger counts m, matching width, common-centering, and unit-device strategies. (Level3)
    
9.  **System verification:** DC operating points, gain, GBW, phase margin (if compensation present), noise, input common-mode range, output swing, and Monte-Carlo for mismatch.

# Additional sizing tips / targets to monitor

-   **Target overdrive (Vov):** choose Vov for desired gm/ID tradeoff; smaller Vov → more gm/ID (good for low-power) but worse matching and noise.
    
-   **Headroom margins:** ensure each stacked device has VDS ≥ Vds\_sat + safety margin (typically 0.1–0.2V). Folded cascode has more stacked devices so check carefully.
    
-   **Matching:** size input devices large enough to meet offset spec under mismatch (use σVth and target offset).
    
-   **Parasitic capacitances:** large W increase Cgd/Cgs and reduce bandwidth; consider compensation.
    
-   **Device multiples (m):** use integer multiples of a unit device for matching and layout.
    
-   **Bias rails:** design VBP2 and VBN1 so cascodes operate correctly across PVT; bias generator sizing may require its own small-signal checks.

If you want, I can now:

-   produce a **short SPICE subckt decomposition** listing explicit subckt pins for each hierarchical block (so you can size each subckt independently), **or**
    
-   provide **recommended numerical W/L starting points** (expressed relative to device unit sizes) for each transistor group given a target ID, VDD and process corners — if you tell me the target supply, target differential pair current, and a preferred Vov range.

Great — using the **complete netlist you provided (including Ccomp, Cload and supply sources)** I re-ran the hierarchical decomposition tailored for an analog **sizing** workflow. Below I give 3 hierarchical levels (coarse → medium → fine). Each subcircuit lists the device names (transistors and the explicit capacitors where relevant). I also include the recommended **sizing order** for each level and short sizing notes where the added components (Ccomp, Cload, VDD) matter.

# Hierarchial 1 — Top logical blocks (coarse blocks; first-pass sizing)

These are the coarse subcircuits you would size first (power & bias → input → gain blocks → outputs).

-   **Subcircuit 1: Bottom sinks / tail currents**
    
    -   Devices: **M10, M11**
        
    -   Purpose: set total branch currents (power budget).
        
    -   First sizing target.
        
-   **Subcircuit 2: Input tail / bias PMOS**
    
    -   Devices: **M3**
        
    -   Purpose: bias for input PMOS pair (VBP1). Set stability of input bias.
        
-   **Subcircuit 3: Differential input pair**
    
    -   Devices: **M1, M2**
        
    -   Purpose: main gm source, noise and input stage — size after currents fixed.
        
-   **Subcircuit 4: PMOS cascode / top load network**
    
    -   Devices: **M4, M5, M6, M7**
        
    -   Purpose: raise output impedance / gain and create folded-cascode topology on top.
        
-   **Subcircuit 5: NMOS folded-path / single-ended converter**
    
    -   Devices: **M8, M9**
        
    -   Purpose: transfer currents to bottom sinks and form output node.
        
-   **Subcircuit 6: Compensation & load**
    
    -   Devices/Parts: **Ccomp (between N001 and Vout), Cload (Vout to 0)**
        
    -   Purpose: dominant pole placement, stability/gain-bandwidth control and load.
        
-   **Subcircuit 7: Supplies / bias nets (explicit sources)**
    
    -   Parts: **vdd (VDD), vss (VSS), vcm (cm), vin/ein1/ein2 drivers, bias nodes VBP1, VBP2, VBN1, VBN2 (nets implicitly driven)**
        
    -   Purpose: set operating points and bias voltages used by above blocks.
        

**Suggested Level-1 sizing order (coarse):**

1.  Subcircuit 1 (M10/M11) — set branch currents.
    
2.  Subcircuit 2 (M3) — set tail bias VBP1.
    
3.  Subcircuit 3 (M1/M2) — choose W/L for gm/noise given currents.
    
4.  Subcircuit 4 (M4–M7) and Subcircuit 5 (M8/M9) — size cascodes and folded-path for gain headroom.
    
5.  Subcircuit 6 (Ccomp, Cload) — select Ccomp to place dominant pole / meet phase margin; verify with Cload.
    

---

# Hierarchial 2 — Functional stages (medium granularity; next-pass sizing)

Group devices into stages you would iterate on after Level-1. Each stage is optimized in sequence but with iterations.

-   **Stage A — Bias & current reference stage**
    
    -   Devices: **M10, M11, M3** (and bias nets VBN2, VBP1)
        
    -   Why first: fixes currents used by subsequent stages. Ensure bottom sinks (M10/M11) remain in saturation over CM range.
        
-   **Stage B — Input differential stage**
    
    -   Devices: **M1, M2** (connected to M3 tail and node N006/N005)
        
    -   Why next: gm and input capacitance determine GBW and noise; set device sizing (W/L, multiples m) now.
        
-   **Stage C — Folded-cascode gain stage**
    
    -   Devices: **M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9** (PMOS cascodes + NMOS folded-path)
        
    -   Why: these determine small-signal gain (ro of loads) and DC headroom. Sizing order inside stage: bias cascode devices (M4/M5) → cascodes (M6/M7) → folded NMOS (M8/M9).
        
-   **Stage D — Output & compensation interaction**
    
    -   Devices/parts: **M7, M9, Ccomp, Cload, Vout net**
        
    -   Why: output resistance and load seen here set final gain, pole locations, and output swing. Tune M7/M9 and Ccomp together to meet stability & slew/GBW tradeoffs.
        
-   **Stage E — Global bias trimming and matching**
    
    -   Devices: all bias nets and mirror ratios (adjust mm\* parameters), matched pairs.
        
    -   Why last: small corrections and offsets.
        

**Suggested Level-2 sizing order:** Bias & sinks (A) → Input pair (B) → Folded-cascode devices (C) → Output + compensation (D) → Final trims (E).

---

# Hierarchial 3 — Fine device groups (layout-aware / final tuning)

These are the fine-grain groups you optimize last for matching, offset, PVT robustness, and layout constraints.

-   **Group 1 — Input matched pair**
    
    -   Devices: **M1, M2**
        
    -   Notes: set identical W/L and device multiples m; choose unit-device strategy for matching and area constraints.
        
-   **Group 2 — Top PMOS mirror / cascode symmetry**
    
    -   Devices: **M4 ⇄ M5** (symmetry), **M6 ⇄ M7** (cascode pairs)
        
    -   Notes: ensure matched sizing between left/right branches to maximize CMRR and minimize systematic offsets.
        
-   **Group 3 — Folded-path NMOS pair and bias**
    
    -   Devices: **M8, M9** and bias net **VBN1**
        
    -   Notes: size for adequate ro and output impedance, but watch parasitic capacitance at Vout.
        
-   **Group 4 — Bottom sink matching & mirror ratio control**
    
    -   Devices: **M10, M11** and bias net **VBN2**
        
    -   Notes: if M10/M11 are part of a current mirror family, pick integer multiples to realize exact currents.
        
-   **Group 5 — Compensation and output tuning**
    
    -   Parts: **Ccomp (N001–Vout), Cload** and devices **M7, M9** connected to Vout
        
    -   Notes: Ccomp location ties node N001 (internal cascode node) to Vout; it affects Miller effect and pole-zero placement. When sizing M7/M9 pay attention to Cgd/Cgs trade-offs and slew behavior with Cload.
        
-   **Group 6 — Device fingers & layout multiplicities**
    
    -   Parameters: `m={...}` across all devices
        
    -   Notes: choose finger counts and unit device sizes to satisfy matching and routing.
        

**Suggested Level-3 sizing order (final tuning):**

1.  Set exact W/L & m for M1/M2 (matching).
    
2.  Tune M6/M7 and M4/M5 to achieve ro and headroom.
    
3.  Adjust M8/M9 for output impedance and DC offset.
    
4.  Finalize M10/M11 mirror ratios.
    
5.  Co-optimize M7/M9 and **Ccomp** for desired phase margin (run AC & transient checks).
    
6.  Apply PVT and Monte-Carlo to verify; iterate.

# Practical notes that reflect the *complete* netlist

1.  **Ccomp (Ccomp N001 Vout {{cc}}p)** sits between the internal cascode node (N001) and the output. In a folded-cascode this is a Miller-like compensation that will:
    
    -   move the dominant pole,
        
    -   create a low-frequency zero depending on the path,
        
    -   interact strongly with M7/M9 sizing and Cload.  
        When you size the cascode and output devices, always run AC with the actual Ccomp value and check phase margin; sizing M7/M9 and Ccomp must be co-optimized.
        
2.  **Cload (1 pF)** at Vout affects required drive strength and slew — large Cload pushes toward larger M7/M9 or more current to meet transient specs.
    
3.  **Supply & bias levels (vdd 1.2V, vss 0V, vcm={vcm})**: ensure each stacked device has enough VDS for saturation. This is especially important for the folded-cascode stack (M1/M6/M4 etc.) — check worst-case common-mode to verify saturation across PVT.
    
4.  **Driver injection (ein1/ein2) & vin source:** these are differential excitations (±0.5×vin) — sizing should guarantee linearity at expected input swings.
    
5.  **Naming mapping:** use the net names N001–N006, Vbp1, Vbp2, Vbn1, Vbn2 when building hierarchical SPICE subckts for easier pin mapping during per-block sizing and simulation.
    

---

# Deliverables I can produce next (pick one)

-   A **subckt decomposition** of the netlist into the Level-1 or Level-2 blocks (SPICE `.subckt` wrappers) so you can simulate/size each block individually.
    
-   Suggested **numerical starting W/L and m values** for each block given target: supply (1.2 V), target differential tail current (specify ID per side), target Vov range.
    
-   An **automated sizing recipe** (equations and example numbers) that converts chosen Vov and ID into W/Ls for PMOS/NMOS using a provided process model (if you give μCox and other process parameters).
    

Tell me which of those you want and I’ll generate it (I won’t ask follow-ups — I’ll assume typical low-voltage design heuristics if you don’t give numbers).
