You: 

You are an experienced analog circuit designer. You are given a SPICE netlist together with hierarchical building block information (transistor names and their functions in the given netlist). You need to do sizing optimization with the following target: Gain >= 1400, UGBW >= 1.0e8, Phrase Margin >= 70, Power <= 1mA with the 65nm PTM technology node. As simultaneously optimize all transistors and design targets with conventional methods (i.e., reinforcement learning or Bayesian Optimization) will result in many redundant simulation steps. Your task is to derive a efficient sizing optimization strategy, based on selecting which block to focus on to each steps, and the weight coefficients to construct Figure of Merits (for example, FoM = w\_g \* (current gain - target gain) + w\_ugbw ( current ugbw - target ugbw) + w\_pm (current phrase margin - target phrase margin) + w\_power (current power - target power)). The generated strategy should be target to quickly achieve the design targets with minimal simulation steps required. Try to output sequence of weight coefficients that avoid suddenly discrupted transitions (quickly jumps or drops) the overall FoM during training. Normalize weight coefficients between 0 and 1, and sum of weight coefficients is 1 Please return your strategy the following format \[ { "selected\_block": \[1, 2\], # Hierarchal Level 1, 2nd subcircuit block, "weight\_coeffients": \[3, 1, 0, 0\], # weight coefficients for gain, ugbw, phrase margin, and power, respectively.

Balance cascode heads to avoid stacking headroom problems. - \*\*Subcircuit 5 (Folded-path NMOS transfer / active load):\*\* M8, M9 \_Purpose:\_ NMOS folded-path transistors translate PMOS differential currents to the bottom NMOS sinks and help form output node. They also form common-mode/ single-ended conversion. \_Objective:\_ ensure correct current steering, maintain ro, and limit systematic offset. \_Knobs / constraints:\_ W/L and bias VBN1 to put these in strong enough inversion for good output resistance but not so large to kill swing. - \*\*Subcircuit 6 (Bias generators for cascodes / NMOS gates):\*\* (implicit bias sources: VBP2 for M6/M7, VBN1 for M8/M9, VBN2 for M10/M11) — Not explicit MOS devices here but important bias nets to tune. \_Purpose:\_ set Vbp2, Vbn1, Vbn2 node voltages. \_Objective:\_ ensure cascodes and sinks remain in required regions and mirror ratios are correct. --- ## Hierarchical Level 2 — Functional stages (medium granularity; next pass) - \*\*Stage 1: Bias & sinks stage:\*\* M10, M11, M3 (and bias nets VBN2, VBP1) \_Sizing order:\_ M10/M11 → M3. \_Why:\_ bottom sinks fix currents; M3 sets the PMOS tail bias that determines differential pair current split. - \*\*Stage 2: Input stage (differential amplifier):\*\* M1, M2 (plus connection to M3) \_Sizing order:\_ pick W/L for M1/M2 to hit gm and noise targets given the currents set in Stage 1. Set device multiples for matching. \_Why:\_ input device gm and input capacitance drive frequency response and noise. - \*\*Stage 3: Folded cascode / gain stage:\*\* M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9 (group PMOS cascodes with NMOS folded transistors) \_Sizing order:\_ cascode biases (VBP2 and M4/M5) → cascode devices M6/M7 → folded NMOS M8/M9. \_Why:\_ these devices determine stage gain (ro of loads) and output node impedance; they must be sized after input gm is known so you can set W/L for required output resistance and headroom. - \*\*Stage 4: Output node and load interaction:\*\* M7 & M9 (the devices directly connected to VOUT) \_Sizing order:\_ refine M7/M9 to meet output swing, output resistance, and load drive. \_Why:\_ this is where single-ended VOUT is formed; adjust to balance DC offset and meet swing. - \*\*Stage 5: Final bias trimming & matching:\*\* all bias nodes and mirror ratios (VBP1, VBP2, VBN1, VBN2) and device multiples. \_Sizing order:\_ iterate after above stages to correct small offsets, common-mode, and gain accuracy. --- ## Hierarchical Level 3 — Fine device groups (final pass / layout-aware) - \*\*Group A: Matched transistor pairs:\*\* - Input pair matching: M1 ↔ M2 (match W/L and layout; set m equal). - Top mirror/cascodes symmetry: M4 ↔ M5 and M6 ↔ M7 if placed symmetrically. \_Objective:\_ minimize systematic offset and preserve CMRR. - \*\*Group B: Current mirror ratio devices (if present):\*\* M3 relative to M10/M11 (if M3 forms part of a mirror) \_Objective:\_ set exact current scaling (unit devices, integer multiples). - \*\*Group C: Cascode bias devices & headroom enforcement:\*\* individual sizing of M6, M7 (cascode transistors) to control VDS on input pair drains and headroom margin. - \*\*Group D: Output pair transconductance tuning:\*\* refine M7 and M9 W/L to satisfy single-ended output swing and impedance to load; check short-circuit and transient behavior. Let's think step by step.
