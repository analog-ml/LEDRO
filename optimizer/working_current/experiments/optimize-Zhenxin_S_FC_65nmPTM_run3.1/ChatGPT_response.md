You: 

You are an experienced analog circuit designer. You are given a SPICE netlist together with hierarchical building block information (transistor names and their functions in the given netlist). You need to do sizing optimization with the following target: Gain >= 1400, UGBW >= 1.0e8, Phrase Margin >= 70, Power <= 1mA with the 65nm PTM technology node. As simultaneously optimize all transistors and design targets with conventional methods (i.e., reinforcement learning or Bayesian Optimization) will result in many redundant simulation steps. Your task is to derive a efficient sizing optimization strategy, based on selecting which block to focus on to each steps, and the weight coefficients to construct Figure of Merits (for example, FoM = w\_g \* (current gain - target gain) + w\_ugbw ( current ugbw - target ugbw) + w\_pm (current phrase margin - target phrase margin) + w\_power (current power - target power)). The generated strategy should be target to quickly achieve the design targets with minimal simulation steps required. Try to output sequence of weight coefficients that avoid suddenly discrupted transitions (quickly jumps or drops) the overall FoM during training. Normalize weight coefficients between 0 and 1, and sum of weight coefficients is 1 Please return your strategy the following format \[ { "selected\_block": \[1, 2\], # Hierarchal Level 1, 2nd subcircuit block, "weight\_coeffients": \[3, 1, 0, 0\], # weight coefficients for gain, ugbw, phrase margin, and power, respectively.

Notes / rationale (short):

-   Metric keys used above: "gain" (linear, not dB), "ugbw" (Hz), "phrase\_margin" (degrees), "power" (A).
    
-   Sequence rationale: first lock the power budget (very cheap simulations to adjust sinks), then push UGBW (input gm tuning is the most bandwidth-efficient move), next increase gain by improving output ro (cascodes), then tune compensation & output node to recover phase margin, and finally do a light global consolidation pass.
    
-   Weight transitions are kept smooth: each phase shifts emphasis gradually (power → ugbw → gain → phase → balanced) to avoid sudden FoM jumps and thus reduce wasted explorations.
    
-   Practical tuning knobs to vary per-phase: transistor widths (W multipliers) first, then small bias voltages (VBP/VBN), then compensation cap (Ccomp). Keep device lengths fixed (lm\*) as in netlist; prefer incremental width changes (e.g., 0.8–1.5× steps during coarse, then 1.05–1.15× for fine).
