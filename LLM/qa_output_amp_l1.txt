Upon reflection, I realize that my previous ranges were not aggressive enough to explore the entire design space. I was stuck in a local maxima, and the reward wasn't improving significantly. To break this cycle, I need to take a step back and reassess my approach.

Initially, I provided ranges that were relatively narrow and centered around the initial data points. While this approach helped to identify some promising regions, it limited the exploration of the design space. The subsequent ranges I provided were not significantly different from the initial ones, which led to a lack of progress.

In the second iteration, I attempted to be more aggressive and expanded the ranges. However, I still didn't achieve the desired performance. Upon reviewing the results, I noticed that the transistors were still not operating in the desired regions.

To improve, I need to take a more holistic approach. I should consider the role of each transistor in the circuit and how they interact with each other. I need to identify the critical transistors that have the most impact on the performance metrics and focus on optimizing those first.

In terms of setting ranges, I should aim to cover a wider range of values, especially for the transistor lengths (nA) and bias voltages (vbias). This will allow for a more thorough exploration of the design space and increase the chances of finding a solution that meets the specs.

Additionally, I should consider the relationships between the different parameters and how they affect the performance metrics. For example, increasing
