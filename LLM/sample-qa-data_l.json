Reward gets more negative when the gain achieved < target gain, UGBW achieved < target UGBW, PM achieved < target PM, power achieved > target power. Basically, you are not penalized for doing better (getting more than target gain, getting lower power, etc). The top performing point I have until now is: metrics- gain:  3.08e+03 , UGBW:  1.46e+08 , PM:  12.1 , power:  3.85e-08 with nA1: 1.74e-07, nB1: 4, nA2: 2.7e-07, nB2: 3, nA3: 1.12e-07, nB3: 3, nA4: 3.44e-07, nB4: 3, nA5: 1.02e-07, nB5: 6, nA6: 1.61e-07, nB6: 4, vbiasp1: 0.4, vbiasp2: 0.258, vbiasn0: 0.43, vbiasn1: 0.219, vbiasn2: 0.457, vcm: 0.4, vdd: 0.8, tempc: 27 and transistor regions MM0 is in sub-threshold, MM1 is in sub-threshold, MM2 is in sub-threshold, MM3 is in sub-threshold, MM4 is in sub-threshold, MM5 is in cut-off, MM6 is in cut-off, MM7 is in cut-off, MM8 is in cut-off, MM9 is in cut-off, MM10 is in cut-off and reward -0.809. Try to get all transistors in what you think will be the correct region of operation by getting their role from the netlist provided earlier and changing parameters for sizing and biasing. \nWhat you need to do and response format guidelines:\nWhat parameters should I change to obtain gain: 3300, funity: 20.0e+6, pm: 70, power: 10e-6? Give me ranges like nA = [#number, #number], etc - i.e. exact ranges for each parameter except vdd, vcm, temp. Note that nB are fins so they are integers, nA are lengths, and Vbias are voltages.\nGive me exact ranges (you should give me a new set of ranges more different from your previous set of ranges if you think you are hitting a local maximum and the reward isn't improving over the past few messages, feel free to be aggressive), and not a strategy strictly inside the ranges I have specified:\n nA1:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB1:[1, 7],  nA2:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB2:[1, 7],  nA3:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB3:[1, 7],  nA4:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB4:[1, 7],  nA5:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB5:[1, 7],  nA6:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB6:[1, 7],  vbiasp1:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasp2:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasn0:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasn1:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasn2:[0.1, 0.8], \n\nStick strictly to inside these ranges. Format your answer as \"parameter: [value, value]\", for example \"nB1: [2, 3]\", every parameter in a new line. That's the only output I want, without any explanations. Keep in mind the past data you were provided, choose ranges based on that information as well as your knowledge of analog circuit design and amplifiers. I will explore again in the ranges you provide. Give me only one set of ranges constrained in the ranges I provided. Also, all your vbias should be lesser than vdd which is 0.8V. Make sure you're not hitting a local reward maxima which will never reach the highest value of 0. Look at all the past ranges you have provided and the results you're getting to make sure it's not happening. Remember all the reflection you did in your past message and what conclusions you drew when making your predictions."}
