Reward gets more negative when the gain achieved < target gain, UGBW achieved < target UGBW, PM achieved < target PM, power achieved > target power. Basically, you are not penalized for doing better (getting more than target gain, getting lower power, etc). Try to get all transistors in what you think will be the correct region of operation by getting their role from the netlist provided earlier and changing parameters for sizing and biasing. \nWhat you need to do and response format guidelines:\nWhat parameters should I change to obtain gain: 3300, funity: 20.0e+6, pm: 70, power: 10e-6? Give me ranges like nA = [#number, #number], etc - i.e. exact ranges for each parameter except vdd, vcm, temp. Note that nB are fins so they are integers, nA are lengths, and Vbias are voltages.\nGive me exact ranges and not a strategy in the ranges as below:\n nA1:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB1:[1, 7],  nA2:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB2:[1, 7],  nA3:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB3:[1, 7],  nA4:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB4:[1, 7],  nA5:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB5:[1, 7],  nA6:[10e-9, 400e-9],  nB6:[1, 7],  vbiasp1:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasp2:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasn0:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasn1:[0.1, 0.8],  vbiasn2:[0.1, 0.8], \n\n Stick strictly to inside these ranges. Format your answer as \"parameter: [value, value]\", for example \"nA1: [5, 6]\", every parameter in a new line. That's the only output I want, without any explanations. Keep in mind the initial data you are provided, choose ranges based on that information as well as your knowledge of analog circuit design and amplifiers. Recognize the role of each transistor here (expecially those with same parameters which might form a symmetric pair), and which region of operation each transistor should operate in for this netlist. I will explore in the ranges you provide"
